## Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch

    1. Implemented gradient descent and closed-form solutions for linear regression using Python, demonstrating a strong grasp of optimization methods and numerical computation.
    
    2. Constructed a personalized implementation of Logistic Regression in Python, entirely devoid of external frameworks. Leveraged concepts such as sigmoid activation, log likelihood, and gradient descent for robust parameter learning.

    3. Created a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with support for linear and non-linear kernel functions, demonstrating expertise in margin maximization and hyperplane classification. on that feature vector is able to predict the response.
